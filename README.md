# ARWizard

This is a prototype.
The project consists of a AR part written in Unity and a machinelearning part in  

Augmented reality enables users to see and interact with objects and effects that are not present in the real world. 
Thus, augmented reality has the possibility to make a more magical world where anything is possible. 
AR-Wizard will use these possibilities of augmented reality to make the users feel, see and even manipulate the magic that we cannot see in the real world.
Through AR-Wizard the users will become powerful wizards fighting off invading zombies with magical spells.
The spells will be conjured by the user correctly performing different hand gestures.
Both augmented reality and machine learning are becoming more popular in the world as the potential in them are huge. This project's focus is to combine the two concepts
A video of the developed prototype can be seen here: [![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/B8vyqE9z9oA/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/B8vyqE9z9oA)

The HMD used in AR-Wizard consists of a Leap Motion https://www.leapmotion.com and an RGB-Camera. 
The Leap Motion will track the hand movement of the user and the features of the gesture will be extracted from the Leap Motion.
The RGB-Camera will provide a visualization of the real world to which the spells and zombies will be placed into.
